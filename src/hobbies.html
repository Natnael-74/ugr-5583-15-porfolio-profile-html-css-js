            <p>
                Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging in various hobbies that allow me to recharge, learn new things, and explore my passions.

        <!-- Hobby 1: Hiking -->
        <section>
            <h3>Hiking and Exploring Nature</h3>
            <p>
                One of my favorite ways to disconnect from the busy world and recharge is by hiking in nature. I love exploring new trails, 
                discovering beautiful landscapes, and challenging myself with different levels of difficulty. Hiking gives me the chance to 
                relax, reflect, and stay active.

            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve recently developed a keen interest in photography. Capturing the beauty of the world around me or a candid moment, 
                is something I truly enjoy. Photography allows me to express my creativity and appreciate the little things in life.
